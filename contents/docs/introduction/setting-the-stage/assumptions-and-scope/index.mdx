## Why Set Boundaries

We’re teaching **driving style as explicit parameters**, not building a full race stack. These constraints keep the physics honest, the maths minimal, and the interactives fast.

---

## World & Track

- **Planar track**, no banking or elevation.
- **Centerline known** a priori (cones → midpoints → spline). No perception, no SLAM.
- Arc-length coordinate and curvature:
```math
s \in [0, L), \quad \kappa(s)
````

* Three fixed demo layouts: S-bend, hairpin, chicane (simple SVGs).

---

## Vehicle Model

* **Backbone:** minimal dynamic/kinematic bicycle (teaching model).
* **State:** position, heading, speed

```math
(x, y, \psi, v)
```

* **Inputs:** steering and longitudinal acceleration

```math
\delta,\; a
```

* **Feasibility via friction circle:**

```math
\sqrt{a_x^2 + a_y^2} \le \mu g, \quad a_y \approx v^2 \kappa(s), \quad a_x = a
```

* **Tyres/Aero:** ignored (no detailed slip model, no downforce, no load transfer).

---

## Controllers Compared

* **Style-Parameterized Controller (ours):** interpretable knobs — **Apex**, **Entry/Exit Bias**, **Risk**, **Smoothness**. Uses preview at

```math
s + L
```

curvature-based speed target, gain scheduling, and gentle command smoothing.

* **MPCC-like Baseline:** qualitative surrogate that captures **contouring/lag/progress** trade-offs via weights (no online QP here). Used only for contrast.

---

## Metrics & Objectives

Primary objective: **minimise lap time** while remaining feasible and understandable.

Reported each run:

* Lap time
* Missed-apex count
* Max lateral

```math
g
```

* Mean jerk (comfort / mechanical sympathy)

---

## What’s In Scope

* Centerline-based planning and control.
* Curvature → speed reasoning with a friction limit.
* Style tuning via four explicit parameters and presets.
* Fast, reproducible browser demos.

---

## What’s Out of Scope

* Perception (cone detection, mapping), multi-car racecraft, strategy.
* Full tyre models, temperature, wear, aero, elevation/banking.
* Robust MPC/QP derivations, solver tuning, warm-starts.
* Hardware minutiae beyond simple rate limits.

---

## Defaults & Constants (for demos)

* Gravity

```math
g = 9.81~\text{m s}^{-2}
```

* Friction coefficient (default **0.9**)

```math
\mu \in [0.6, 1.2]
```

* Preview distance (track-dependent default)

```math
L = 12~\text{m}
```

* Steering/accel **rate limits** enabled; first-order low-pass on commands.

You’ll be able to vary

```math
\mu,\; L
```

and the four style knobs in the playground.

---

## Known Limitations

* The MPCC-like surrogate **illustrates trends**; it is **not** a solved QP.
* Without tyre slip and load transfer, high-g accuracy is limited; the goal is **qualitative style** differences, not absolute lap times.
* “Smoothness” is communicated via command filtering and rate limits, not full chassis compliance.

---

## Quick Checks

* If friction drops from

```math
\mu = 1.0 \rightarrow 0.8
```

the curvature-limited speed scales by

```math
\sqrt{0.8} \approx 0.894\times
```

* If preview distance

```math
L
```

is too large, expect **late rotation** and **apex overshoot** on tight corners.
