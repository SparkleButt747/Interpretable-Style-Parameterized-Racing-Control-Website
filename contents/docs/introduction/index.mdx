title: What You’ll Learn
description: A fast, visual roadmap of what you’ll learn in this project—driving style as explicit parameters, curvature→speed reasoning, and how this contrasts with MPCC.

## In One Hour, You Will Be Able To

- **Predict behaviour from four knobs** — *Apex*, *Entry/Exit Bias*, *Risk*, *Smoothness* — before you press “run.”
- **Read a curvature→speed plot** and explain the **friction-circle** limit without tyre-magic hand-waving.
- **Explain why naive “aim-at-a-point” control fails** (no preview, no curvature awareness, unstable gains) and how simple fixes help.
- **Contrast an interpretable controller with an MPCC-like baseline**: similar outcomes, very different *legibility* of “style.”
- **Use a minimal Dynamic Bicycle model** as the physics backbone for transparent reasoning and demos.

## Who This Is For

- Final-year undergrads / early grads in **CS/EE/Robotics**.
- Comfortable with vectors, basic kinematics, and PID-level control.
- New to vehicle control, optimal control, or racing dynamics.

> If you’ve ever tuned a controller and wondered *what exactly changed the driving style*, this is for you.

## Learning Outcomes

| You will be able to…                                   | Evidence you’ll produce                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Map **curvature** to **feasible speed**                | Annotated curvature–speed plot with μ-scaled caps             |
| Explain the **friction circle** qualitatively          | Correct trade-off reasoning between lateral/longitudinal accel|
| Tune **style parameters** and predict the outcome      | “Predict-before-play” quiz ≥ 70% on first attempt             |
| Diagnose **naive controller** failure modes            | Short write-up: oscillation, late braking, apex misses        |
| Compare **Style-Param** vs **MPCC-like** controllers   | Side-by-side laps + metric table, explain differences         |

## The Four Style Knobs (Mental Model)

- **Apex** — where the path “leans” near peak curvature (inside/center/outside).
- **Entry/Exit Bias** — where you budget decel/rotation (earlier vs later).
- **Risk** — how closely you run against the curvature-implied speed cap.
- **Smoothness** — how aggressively you allow steering/throttle to change.

> These are **explicit** parameters in our controller. With MPCC, similar behaviour emerges by tweaking **weights/constraints**, but the mapping is **indirect**.

## What We Won’t Do

- No full tyre models, no aero, no online QP derivations.
- No perception stack: we assume a known centerline/track for teaching clarity.
- No racecraft (overtakes, blocking). This is about **style** and **control**.

## Time & Flow

- **~60 minutes** end-to-end.  
- Each section = **one idea + one interactive + one micro-check**.
