  Instead of an optimization-based controller (MPCC), we compare against simple baselines
  that are stable, reproducible, and easy to reason about:
  Pure Pursuit and Stanley for steering, plus PID for speed.

## Baseline A: Pure Pursuit (steering)

Pick a lookahead target and compute curvature-to-target.

A common form:
$$
\delta = \arctan\left(\frac{2L\sin\alpha}{L_d}\right)
$$

where $\alpha$ is the angle to the lookahead point and $L_d$ is the lookahead distance.

## Longitudinal baseline: PID speed tracking

$$
a_x = K_p(v_t - v) + K_i\int(v_t - v)dt + K_d\frac{d(v_t - v)}{dt}
$$

## Why this comparison is still strong

- It’s simple enough to implement robustly.
- It has clear “knobs” (lookahead, gains, smoothing).
- It provides fair head-to-head ghost races.
- It keeps your focus: **interpretable style parameters**.
