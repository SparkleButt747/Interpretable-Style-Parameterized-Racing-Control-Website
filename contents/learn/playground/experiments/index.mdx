  The point is not just to run sliders.
  The point is to <strong>predict</strong>, then run, then explain what happened.

## Experiment 1 — Lookahead vs oscillation (S-bend)

**Prediction:** As $L$ increases, oscillation should drop, but apexing becomes lazier.

**Do:**
- Sweep $L$ from small → large
- Log $\text{RMSE}(e_\perp)$, overshoot count, and lap time

**Expected shape:** U-ish curve (too small is unstable, too large is inaccurate).

## Experiment 2 — Apex offset and entry/exit bias (Hairpin)

**Prediction:** Later apex helps exit speed; entry bias helps rotation but may hurt exit.

**Do:**
- Sweep apex offset $p_{\text{apex}}$
- Sweep bias $p_{\text{bias}}$
- Record lap time, apex hit/miss, exit speed

## Experiment 3 — Pareto: lap time vs jerk (Chicane)

**Prediction:** More aggression buys small time for large jerk.

**Do:**
- Sweep risk and smoothness
- Plot lap time vs mean jerk
- Choose a point on the Pareto frontier and justify it
