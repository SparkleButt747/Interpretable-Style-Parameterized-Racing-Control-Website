## Experiment 1 — Lookahead vs oscillation (S-bend)

**Prediction:** As $L$ increases, oscillation should drop, but apexing becomes lazier.

**Do:**
- Sweep $L$ from small → large
- Log $\text{RMSE}(e_\perp)$, overshoot count, and lap time

**Expected shape:** U-ish curve (too small is unstable, too large is inaccurate).

  [PLOT PLACEHOLDER] $L$ vs $\text{RMSE}(e_\perp)$ and overshoot count
</div>

## Experiment 2 — Apex offset and entry/exit bias (Hairpin)

**Prediction:** Later apex helps exit speed; entry bias helps rotation but may hurt exit.

**Do:**
- Sweep apex offset $p_{\text{apex}}$
- Sweep bias $p_{\text{bias}}$
- Record lap time, apex hit/miss, exit speed

<div className="my-6 rounded-2xl border bg-muted/20 p-6 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
  [TABLE PLACEHOLDER] Runs grid: settings → lap time / exit speed / apex flags
</div>

## Experiment 3 — Pareto: lap time vs jerk (Chicane)

**Prediction:** More aggression buys small time for large jerk.

**Do:**
- Sweep risk and smoothness
- Plot lap time vs mean jerk
- Choose a point on the Pareto frontier and justify it

<div className="my-6 rounded-2xl border bg-muted/20 p-6 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
  [PARETO PLACEHOLDER] Scatter: $T_{\text{lap}}$ vs mean jerk; highlight frontier

## What to write in your logbook (template)

For each experiment:
- What you predicted
- What happened (with one screenshot/plot)
- Why it happened (tie to preview/curvature/limits)
- One change you made based on the result
