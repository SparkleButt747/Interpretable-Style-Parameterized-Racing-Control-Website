  These are designed to test the real skill:
  can you <strong>predict</strong> behaviour from a controller setting before you run it?
</div>

<Separator className="my-10" />

## Quiz 1 — Core concepts (short)

Covers:
- lookahead stability trade-offs
- curvature → speed intuition
- friction budget interpretation
- gain scheduling and smoothing

  [QUIZ PLACEHOLDER] Multiple choice + short “explain your choice” prompts
</div>

<Separator className="my-10" />

## Quiz 2 — Prediction quiz

You’ll be given:
- a track segment
- a knob setting
- and you must choose the expected outcome (wide apex? oscillation? jerk spike?)

<div className="my-6 rounded-2xl border bg-muted/20 p-6 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
  [QUIZ PLACEHOLDER] “Predict the trace” items: choose which trajectory/plot matches
</div>

<Separator className="my-10" />

## Design task — pick a style for Track X

**Task:** Choose style knobs to achieve a goal:
- fastest lap
- or smoothest within 0.5s of fastest
- or robust under low $\mu$

You must justify with at least:
- one prediction
- one run result
- one metric plot

## Wrap-up

If you can consistently predict outcomes before running,
you understand the ideas at the right level.
