  You output <strong>two numbers</strong> every few milliseconds:
  <strong> steering</strong> and <strong>throttle/brake</strong>.
  Everything else is choosing them well—given the path, the limits, and the style you want.

## What this course project teaches

You’ll learn to reason about racing control in a way that is **predictable** and **teachable**:

- Start from a naive “aim at a point and go” baseline.
- Add just enough physics and constraints to explain real failure modes.
- Build an **interpretable** controller where *style is explicit*.
- Compare against an **MPCC-like** baseline where style is mostly hidden in weights.

## Your mission

By the end you should be able to:

1) Predict how changing **lookahead** changes stability and apexing  
2) Explain why curvature forces a speed limit (grip budget)  
3) Use knobs like **apex offset** and **entry/exit bias** to “shape” driving  
4) Justify trade-offs: lap time vs jerk vs consistency

    <li>Apex offset shifts where the car cuts the corner</li>
    <li>Entry/exit bias shifts when you rotate vs accelerate</li>
    <li>Risk changes how close you run to friction saturation</li>
    <li>Smoothness shapes command rates / jerk</li>
  </ul>

## Challenge mode: beat the ghosts

You’ll tune a style-parameterized controller and race:

- A conservative preview baseline
- An MPCC-like “ghost” (strong baseline)
