  You output <strong>two numbers</strong> every few milliseconds:
  <strong> steering</strong> $\delta$ and <strong>throttle/brake</strong> $a_x$.
  This project shows how a small, interpretable controller can drive with different “styles”
  by changing a few meaningful parameters.

## What you’ll learn (in one hour)

- Why “just steer to the next point” fails (oscillation / lazy apex / too-fast entry)
- How preview (lookahead) stabilizes steering
- How curvature implies a speed limit (grip budget)
- How simple PID speed control tracks a curvature-limited target speed
- How “style” can be exposed as explicit knobs (apex offset, entry/exit bias, risk, smoothness)
- How your style-parameterized controller compares to simple baselines (Pure Pursuit / Stanley + PID)

## Challenge mode

Tune style knobs and try to beat:
1) a conservative baseline, and  
2) an aggressive baseline.  

Same track, same start. Your job: pick parameters that fit the corner sequence.
