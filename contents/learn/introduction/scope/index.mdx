## What this project is (and is not)

We’re building a **teaching simulator** for racing control ideas:
fast, stable, and interpretable.

We intentionally do **not** build a full perception stack or a high-fidelity tire model.

## Assumptions

We assume we have:

- State estimate $(x,y,\psi,v)$ at each control tick
- A reference path $\gamma(s)$ with curvature $\kappa(s)$
- A grip estimate $\mu$ and actuator limits

## In scope

- Preview/lookahead targeting
- Curvature $\kappa$ → target speed
- Gain scheduling (speed-dependent steering authority)
- Command smoothing / jerk limiting
- **Style parameters** (apex offset, entry/exit bias, risk, smoothness)
- MPCC as a **foil** (qualitative + surrogate ghost)

## Out of scope

- Full MPCC derivation and QP/SQP solver internals
- Full vehicle dynamics (load transfer, aero, thermal tire effects)
- Perception (camera/LiDAR, SLAM, fusion)
- Real vehicle safety cases / hardware actuation details

## Glossary (short)

- **Lookahead** $L$: distance ahead to aim toward  
- **Curvature** $\kappa$: path “tightness” (bigger magnitude = tighter turn)  
- **Contouring error** $e_\perp$: lateral deviation from path  
- **Lag error** $e_\parallel$: along-track mismatch  
- **Friction budget**: limit on combined lateral and longitudinal acceleration

## Where the “realism” line is drawn

We’ll use a lightweight model plus a friction limit so learners can see:
**knob → behaviour** immediately.

Next page: the canonical “plant and limits” we’ll rely on everywhere.
