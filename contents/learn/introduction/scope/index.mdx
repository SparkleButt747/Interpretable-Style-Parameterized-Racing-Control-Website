## Scope (teaching-first)

We focus on **control**, not perception.  
We assume the simulator gives us $(x,y,\psi,v)$ and a reference path $\gamma(s)$.

## In scope

- Geometric path tracking (Pure Pursuit / Stanley)
- Curvature-aware target speed
- PID speed tracking
- Gain scheduling + rate limiting / jerk limiting
- Explicit style parameters (apex offset, entry/exit bias, risk, smoothness)
- Baseline comparisons via tuned presets (Conservative vs Aggressive)

## Out of scope

- Full perception stack (cones → path)
- High-fidelity tire/aero modeling
- Optimization-based MPC/MPCC solvers

## Glossary

- **Lookahead** $L$: how far ahead you “aim”  
- **Curvature** $\kappa$: how tight the path is  
- **Cross-track error** $e_y$: lateral distance from path  
- **Heading error** $e_\psi$: difference between car heading and path tangent  
- **Friction budget**: combined limit on turning and accelerating
