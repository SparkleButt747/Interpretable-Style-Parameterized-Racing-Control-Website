This playground spins up the TypeScript port of the velox `SimulationDaemon` directly in the browser. Configuration
and parameter YAML files are pulled from the local `config/` and `parameters/` directories using a lightweight
in-memory fetcher so you can try different vehicles without leaving the page.

### How to drive

- `W` / `S` (or Up / Down) to throttle and brake.
- `A` / `D` (or Left / Right) to steer.
- `Shift` toggles the drift guard and `R` restarts the current run.

### Vehicle data

- Vehicle options are loaded from `parameters/vehicle/parameters_vehicle*.yaml` and their descriptions are derived from
  the header comments in each YAML file.
- Model timing defaults are surfaced via `config/model_timing.yaml` so the daemon no longer falls back silently.
- If a file is missing, the UI will show a warning banner and keep the previous good state running.
