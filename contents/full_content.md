# Learn Content Skeleton

Content coming soon for the reorganized learn pages:

- /introduction — why this exists, what you'll learn, challenge mode
  - /introduction/problem — the problem and a naive baseline that fails
  - /introduction/scope — assumptions, scope, glossary
- /core/plant-and-limits — single source of truth for state, inputs, kinematic bicycle, friction circle, curvature-to-speed
- /controllers/preview-and-speed — lookahead, target speed, gain scheduling, smoothing
- /controllers/style-parameterized — knob set, behaviour mapping, pseudo-code
- /playground — simulator, overlays, metrics, export
  - /playground/experiments — guided experiments (predict → run → reflect)
- /quizzes — two short quizzes and the design-your-style-for-track-X task

Content rule: if a page needs the bike model or friction circle, link to /core/plant-and-limits and include only a one-sentence recap plus a single symbol reference (no full equations).
